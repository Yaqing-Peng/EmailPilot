## Notes

### Webpack Installation
If `npm run build` works without additional setup, there's no need to install Webpack separately. However, if `npm run build` fails, install Webpack using:
```bash
npm install -g webpack webpack-cli
```

### Storage Requirements
Ensure you have at least 22 GB free storage before downloading Gemini Nano. The AI model will not work otherwise.

### Extensions Loading
Always make sure you load the unpacked `dist` folder in Chrome to run the extension locally.
